# Canton MCP Server: Canonical Pattern Research Plan

## Executive Summary

Before we can build a cryptographically-verified canonical pattern system, we need to deeply understand what constitutes "correct" and "canonical" DAML code. This research plan outlines how to systematically gather, analyze, and document the fundamental knowledge required.

**Goal**: Build an authoritative knowledge base of DAML patterns, anti-patterns, and validation rules based on verifiable sources.

**Timeline**: 4-6 weeks (depending on team size)

**Team Size**: 3-5 researchers recommended

---

## Research Objectives

### Primary Objectives
1. **Understand DAML formal semantics** - What does the spec actually define?
2. **Catalog proven patterns** - What patterns are demonstrably correct?
3. **Identify anti-patterns** - What mistakes happen in practice?
4. **Extract validation rules** - What can be mechanically checked?
5. **Document Canton specifics** - Privacy, security, multi-domain considerations

### Success Criteria
- [ ] Complete DAML authorization model documented
- [ ] 10-15 canonical patterns identified and validated
- [ ] 10-15 anti-patterns documented with detection rules
- [ ] Formal validation rules extracted from DAML compiler
- [ ] All findings traceable to authoritative sources

## Risk Management

### Identified Risks

1. **Source Conflicts**
   - **Risk**: Different sources give conflicting guidance
   - **Mitigation**: Prioritize by authority (spec > docs > practice), document conflicts

2. **Incomplete Documentation**
   - **Risk**: DAML documentation may have gaps
   - **Mitigation**: Use compiler source as ground truth, note assumptions

3. **Resource Availability**
   - **Risk**: Team members may have competing priorities
   - **Mitigation**: Buffer time in schedule, clear expectations upfront

4. **Scope Creep**
   - **Risk**: Research could expand indefinitely
   - **Mitigation**: Strict scope definition, time-box research phase

5. **Bias Toward Current Codebase**
   - **Risk**: Being influenced by our test contracts rather than ground truth
   - **Mitigation**: Start with spec, validate against multiple sources

### Contingency Plans

- If team smaller than 3 people: Prioritize workstreams 1, 2, 3
- If timeline pressure: Focus on highest-confidence sources (spec + compiler)
- If source conflicts: Create "disputed patterns" section with documentation

---

- [ ] 10-15 anti-patterns documented with real-world examples
