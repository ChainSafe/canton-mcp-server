# Canton MCP Server - Resource Files

## ⚠️ IMPORTANT: PLACEHOLDER CONTENT

**All resource files in this directory are PLACEHOLDERS for development and testing purposes only.**

These files were created during Story 1.2 implementation to:
- Test the resource loading system
- Demonstrate the directory structure
- Validate hot-reload functionality
- Provide examples for the YAML schema format

## What's Here

- `patterns/` - Sample DAML pattern resources (PLACEHOLDERS)
- `anti-patterns/` - Sample anti-pattern resources (PLACEHOLDERS)  
- `rules/` - Sample rule resources (PLACEHOLDERS)
- `docs/` - Sample documentation resources (PLACEHOLDERS)

## Next Steps

These placeholder resources will be replaced with real canonical patterns, anti-patterns, rules, and documentation during:
- **Story 1.3**: Define Resource YAML Schemas
- **Story 1.4**: Create Initial Canonical Resources

## Development Notes

- All placeholder resources include `placeholder` tag
- Descriptions are prefixed with "PLACEHOLDER:"
- Authors are marked as "PLACEHOLDER"
- Content is example/placeholder data only

**Do not use these resources in production!**
